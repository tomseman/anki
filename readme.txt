This is my personal anki deck space.
In LINUX use >>export ANKI_BASE=/path/to/this/location/anki_base 
to start anki within this location. Use the terminal to start anki after
exporting the path >>anki

In VSCode use the Addon "Anki for VSCode" to create AnkiDecks using markdown 
files. 
Use CTRL+Shift+P and >Anki: Send to own Deck
Also make sure AnkiConnect is available in this location.
